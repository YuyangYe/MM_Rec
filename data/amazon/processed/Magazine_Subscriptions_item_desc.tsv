In 1925, Harold Ross established
The New Yorker
as a lighthearted, Manhattan-centric magazine—a “fifteen-cent comic paper,” he called it. Today, it is considered by many to be the most influential magazine in the world. The New Yorker stands apart for its commitment to truth and accuracy, for the quality of its prose, and for its insistence on exciting and moving every reader.
Amazon.com Review
For readers who demand the very best,
The New Yorker
delivers unparalleled reporting and commentary on politics and foreign affairs, business and technology, popular culture and the arts, along with humor, fiction, poetry, and, of course, cartoons. The creativity, influence, and impact that have characterized The New Yorker since its founding are today amplified far beyond its pages.  A subscription keeps readers in the know no matter where they find themselves, whether in the publication’s namesake city or trotting around the globe.
The New Yorker
’s influence is best summarized by its editor, David Remnick: “Some publications are all about predictability.
The New Yorker
's predictability resides only in its quality, its attention to accuracy, and the depth of its reporting. Beyond that, it is the most unpredictable of publications. It takes on the big subjects—politics, culture, the natural world—but it does so in ways that are unique.
The New Yorker
is about the originality of its writers, its artists, and its other contributors, all of whom explore the world and the world of ideas with complete editorial freedom."

Comparisons to Other Magazines:
Over the past five decades,
Seventeen
has helped shape teenage life in America.
Seventeen
has represented an important rite of passage, helping to define, socialize and empower young women.
Seventeen
has been a significant force for change—creating notions of beauty and style, proclaiming what’s hot in music and movies, identifying social issues, celebrating the idols and icons of popular culture. One of the most buzz-worthy programs is the “
Seventeen
Body Peace Project,” a year-long initiative to help girls stop obsessing about what their body looks like, start appreciating it for what it can do, and ultimately make peace with their bodies.
Seventeen
also partnered with MySpace, the largest social networking site, to launch the ground-breaking Web reality program “Freshman 15,” which gives millions of teens an inside scoop on the often overwhelming emotional and lifestyle changes taking place at college.
Advertising:
Seventeen
readers have a passion for a variety of products. Advertisers include fashion, retail, footwear, accessories, beauty and health products. These range from luxury goods to everyday essentials targeted to fashion conscious, trendy young women. ----------------------------- The perky authority on all things girl since 1944,
Seventeen
magazine still provides advice and encouragement to masses of young misses. Although the primary focus is fashion and famous folk, this teen zine is not mere eye candy. Mixed among the cutting-edge styles (and multitudinous ads) you'll find short but plentiful articles. Topics range in import: fluff stuff like ""What Will You Wear Back to School?"" and ""The Ultimate Ponytail Guide"" is balanced by heavier fodder, such as ""No One Believes I Was Raped"" and pieces on having a gay sibling and the dangers of binge drinking. Skewed largely toward a Caucasian teen audience, the magazine's coverage of beauty and relationship conundrums does offer nods to young women of color. The tone is resolutely positive, and amid all the talk of must-have hairdos and hottie alerts, the message is girl power in its most nonthreatening guise.

Who Reads
Lucky
?
Lucky
magazine is the only magazine devoted exclusively to shopping and style. A pioneer in the fashion magazine field, it provides women who are passionate about shopping with a broad range of the best styles and products out there--but a tight edit of the pieces that are worth a second look. As the voice of a friend in the know,
Lucky
makes fashion and beauty fun and accessible for everyone, showcasing what to wear and how to wear it.  The magazine features gorgeous photography and an endless array of product shots--and every item comes with how-to-get it-right-now information next to its photo (pricing, website, phone number, store location). Readers don’t have to flip to the back of the book to read the fine print on how much something costs--and they can buy it right then and there. It’s all about instant gratification.
Lucky
also shows readers a variety of price points—you’ll see a pair of $300 shoes next to a $30 pair.
Lucky
’s editors offer real-life women advice on how to wear the latest trends in a way that’s flattering and right for their shape and size: they don’t assume one size or trend fits all. It’s all about accessibility, and remembering that fashion is supposed to be fun, not stressful. There’s also advice on how to ""shop your own closet"": you don’t need to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe each season—just a few key pieces and styling tricks can turn a summer piece into a fall one.  Since
Lucky
’s launch in December 2000, circulation has rocketed from 500,000 to over 1.1 million, proving to be one of the most successful launches in Conde Nast history.

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC KIDS is a fact-filled, fast-paced magazine created especially for ages 6 and up. With an award-winning combination of photos, facts, and fun, NG KIDS has captivated its more than one million readers for over 35 years. Articles and departments entertain and inspire readers to learn about their world with amazing information about animals, science, technology, archaeology, geography, and pop culture, plus jokes, games, activities in every issue.
Amazon.com Review
National Geographic Kids magazine is aimed at young readers from six years and up who want to find out more about the world around them. The magazine contains a superb blend of photos, fun facts, and articles presented in a cheery style, making it perfect for keeping kids' attention. National Geographic Kids magazine has been presenting information to kids in an accessible way for over thirty-five years.  You can expect the same kind of subjects to be included in National Geographic Kids magazine that you get in the adult version-animals, science, archaeology, and geography-but with technology and pop culture added to the mix too. As you might expect, there is also a strong emphasis on magnificent wildlife photography. Frequent appearances of animal posters can be found within the pages, as well as high-quality photographs sprinkled throughout the magazine. The addition of games and jokes, alongside other activities such as puzzles and competitions, keeps the subjects light, while still getting across the important facts.  Your children can explore ancient civilizations on one page, come face-to-face with exotic wildlife on another, and turn the next page to a make and do project, which is often perfect for homework. There are always plenty of gross/interesting facts about animals that your children are certain to share with you, or they can turn to the page that gives them the low-down on their favorite star. Regular competitions are sure to keep your kids involved too.  This quality publication ensures that your children learn while still having fun, so they are more likely to retain the information. National Geographic Kids magazine really helps to bring the world to life, and gets your children excited about learning."

Penthouse magazine has entertained and delighted men since 1965 with its pictures of beautiful, scantily-clad (if at all) women and hot sex articles. In the 1990s, it went through a change to a harder-core format, but since 2005 has come back to its roots of soft-core pornography and erotica.  Columns in Penthouse magazine feature lots of sexually-explicit content and pictures of women designed to delight men. The famous Penthouse Forum, which publishes explicit letters from readers, is still a monthly feature. Several explicit pictorials run every month, some focusing on a specific model and others featuring several models around a theme like women with all-natural bodies or women from the military. A centerfold and accompanying pictorial features that month's Penthouse Pet. Other articles include interviews with Penthouse Pets, longer articles about sex-themed topics like sex museums and the BDSM world, and sexual adventure stories.  Penthouse magazine is not all about sex, though. Men will also find technology and fashion well-covered throughout each month's issue. Buying guides help you find the best electronics, toys, and man-themed gifts. Full Frontal, a monthly featured column, covers entertainment including gaming, movies, and DVDs. Other male indulgences like great scotch or premium cigars are frequent topics of discussion, as are hunting, fast cars, and sports.  Ultimately, Penthouse magazine is designed for men who aren't afraid to be men. Now that the magazine has come back to the great soft-core sex content that has always been its strength, it's time to take another look."

Spin focuses on the progressive new music scene and young adult culture involved with alternative music. Each issue includes reviews, essays, profiles and interviews on a range of music from rock to jazz.
Amazon.com Review
Founded in 1985 by
Penthouse
publisher Bob Guccione's son, Bob Jr.,
Spin
magazine aimed to occupy a space forged and outgrown by
Rolling Stone
, which had since moved on from counter-culture reporting to a more pop-culture focus. Due to its well-funded birth,
Spin
rode the wave of the burgeoning alternative rock movement and was afforded the luxury of being as controversial as it wanted, forsaking at times somewhat slanted reporting in favor of the punch and jibe. Nonetheless, it brought into America's peripheral vision early stories of the ravages of AIDS in Africa, in addition to standard artist interviews and album reviews. Switching from a tabloid format to a glossy perfect-bound publication, the magazine now reports on fleeting music trends and the Next Big Thing more than it unearths alternative-rock gems, but it still does a good job of uncovering behind-the-scenes-stories, such as the violent acts and deplorably unhygienic conditions of 1999's Woodstock III music festival, in a way no other music magazine does. When the Beastie Boys released
Hello Nasty
in 1998,
Spin
published three different editions of the magazine--each with a separate headshot of one member of the renegade hip-hop group. Three years later,
Rolling Stone
copied the gimmick, featuring the members of boy band 'N Sync individually on five different covers. If
Spin
's influence in rock journalism was ever in question, this event provides irrefutable proof.

is the national magazine of organic and sustainable farming. In continuous publication for over 35 years,
Acres U.S.A.
reaches more commercial-scale organic and sustainable farmers than any other publication in North America.
Begun in 1970, when there were merely a few lone souls practicing eco-agriculture, farming that is both economical and ecological,
Acres U.S.A.
founder and executive editor Charles Walters recognized how the methodical cheating of small farmers and the enforced swing toward new, chemical agriculture were gears in the same machine, working in tandem to transform the countryside -- and not for the better. Corporate power and public policy were colluding in the destruction of the family farm, and the process of annihilation was gathering speed. Walters met, interviewed and presented to the public the works of soil scientists, farmers, economic thinkers and farm policy experts who were gradually being pushed aside by mainstream publications in favor of more modern, and more toxic, solutions. He worked tirelessly to reveal the inadequacies of chemical farming, and promoted gently coaxing nature into yielding her bounty.
Decades later,
Acres U.S.A.
readers continue to receive the latest news and in-depth analyses of ecological agriculture technologies, economic issues and environmental news each month. They meet successful eco-farmers through case reports. Top figures in eco-agriculture share their stories, struggles and successes through the
Acres U.S.A.
Interview. And eco-agriculture is brought full-circle through countless discussions of complex veterinary and human health and healing issues. Add in regular columns on marketing, grazing, tillage methods, soils, weed and insect control, high-value crops, news from around the world, meetings, and more, and youll begin to understand the scope of what
Acres U.S.A.
offers.
Based on the work of scientists and farmers whose sophisticated approach to agriculture reveals chemical farming as obsolete and misguided,
Acres U.S.A.
teaches readers how to embrace the science of nature. Rather than batter nature into submission with bizarre chemistry that short-circuits natural processes, sustainable farmers feed the soil and bring it into balance. Subsequently, they are rewarded with superior crops and lower input costs.
Acres U.S.A.
has helped thousands of farmers feed the nation's growing appetite for clean, delicious food and showed them how to make a profit while they're at it.
Acres U.S.A.
holds a unique understanding of and role in the eco-agriculture movement, introducing readers to the experts who are putting both new practices and proven methods to work in the field. Were not reporting on trends from afar; our writers are experts in their field, providing high-level, useful information for serious farmers.
Acres U.S.A.
is independent of government, Extension, the universities, agribusiness and the agrichemical industry. Were a family-owned business and an outspoken authority on eco-farming, unfettered from any outside interests. We aim for comprehensive coverage of the multitude of issues within the vast field of farming.
Learn from the oldest and largest magazine focusing on sustainable agriculture, emphasizing practical, soils up advice for sophisticated, innovative farmers. Leading the movement toward chemical-free agriculture for over 35 years, our readers rely on
Acres U.S.A.
for the latest techniques for growing bountiful, nutritious crops and raising healthy, vibrant livestock."

Who Reads
Teen Vogue
?
Teen Vogue
is a fashion magazine for teenagers who are passionate about style, the fashion industry, beauty, health, and entertainment news. Published ten times a year, it represents the best in teen fashion through gorgeous photography, world-class styling, access to the fashion industry's brightest stars, and breaking news about health and family issues, as well as beauty tips. The
Teen Vogue
reader is a young woman engaged with life through style, education, giving back (as seen in the regular Charity page), and an interest in beauty and health. Its most ardent readers even go so far as buying two copies of the magazine each month -- one for ripping out pages to paste on their walls and in their inspiration boards, and one to read and save forever as part of their ""style library.""
What You Can Expect in Each Issue:
Talking Fashion: These image-driven pages are filled with paparazzi and backstage photos of the brightest stars in the Teen Vogue orbit, from model Agyness Deyn and Kate Bosworth to Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers.

Features: Everything that is published in Teen Vogue is filtered through the lens of fashion and style. Recent cover subjects include ""Heroes"" star Hayden Panettiere, Blake Lively from ""Gossip Girl,"" Ellen Page from ""Juno"", and Rihanna. Past Issues:  Contributors: Contributors are culture- and style-obsessed writers and editors who know the scoop on fashion, music and movies way before the rest of the world. They're experts at spotting trends that teens will want to wear every season, and they cover health topics and beauty secrets that matter to our readers.  Magazine Layout:  An intensely visual magazine, Teen Vogue features modern, vibrant fashion stories photographed by some of the best photographers in the world, including Bruce Weber, Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort and David Bailey. They travel across the world and back to locations that imbue our stories with a sense of adventure, sophistication and chic originality. At the same time, it also prides itself on delivering breaking news about health and relationship trends, as well as offering advice about breaking into the fashion industry as a whole.  Comparisons to Other Magazines:  Teen Vogue touches on relationships here and there, sure, but its reason d'etre is style, and to that end, it covers fashion news, travel around the world to photograph the coolest clothes in exotic settings (China, India, the Caribbean... the list goes on!), and deliver the most amazing new music and movies, college reports, and career advice instead of dispensing boy advice, quizzes, and embarrassing stories.  Advertising:  There is a close synergy between the advertisers in Teen Vogue, the actual content of the magazine, and the brands that readers love. It's basically seamless -- and driven by fashion at both the high end as well as more affordable sportswear and action brands. Each issue features an ""In This Issue"" section, which lists all fashion credits from our major stories, as well as URLs and phone numbers that allow readers to contact the companies. Teen Vogue's advertising is wholly relevant and targeted toward the fashion-forward, culture- and beauty-obsessed teen.

Created especially for girls age 8 and up, American Girl is an appealing, age-appropriate alternative to teen magazines. Features advice, crafts, contests, puzzles, games, giggles, and more!
Amazon.com Review
American Girl magazine is an appropriate, entertaining, and informative magazine for girls over eight years old. A great alternative to more traditional teen magazines, each issue of American Girl magazine includes craft ideas, puzzles, contests, advice, games, and other fun activities and articles.  If you have daughters or granddaughters, American Girl magazine is a great preteen magazine that they can turn to for fun party ideas like back-to-school sleepovers or crafting ideas they can use to decorate their rooms in unique and colorful ways. Many parents like the fact that the magazine doesn't put too much focus on boys, makeup, and other more subjects to which girls are often overexposed.  In addition to all of the fun information packed into each issue of American Girl magazine, the magazine also contains useful articles that can help girls deal with everyday problems they may face, such as how to handle relationship issues with friends. Each issue celebrates girls' creativity, self-expression, and independence and fosters a sense of confidence in its readers.  The magazine is a great gift idea for any girl over the age of eight, but especially those in their preteen years who are looking for ways to boost their self-confidence and become smart, strong young women. American Girl magazine stresses the importance of learning and education and doesn't focus on more frivolous subjects that girls often preoccupy themselves with. It encourages girls to be good citizens in their communities and good role models for those around them."

""Destinations, Adventures, Dreams"" promises the masthead, and this magazine delivers. Unlike many other travel magazines that are really general lifestyle publications,
Islands
focuses entirely on islands--as vacation destinations and as cultures. Packed with information helpful for planning a vacation, this magazine helps make the dream a reality, spotlighting a wide variety of price points and destinations. While giving great attention to tropical climates, contributors also visit temperate locations. Stories are written with a personal touch--personal experiences intermingle with details on the location, including social, economic, and political dimensions. Vivid photographs and maps give the reader a better sense of the locations (and a desire to visit immediately!). Advertisements pertain directly to vacation planning, including rentals, resorts, and airfares. Subscribe for the dream of the island getaway, but be careful--you may just find yourself booking it.

As the oldest continuously published magazine in the country, Scientific American magazine has been reporting on the latest breakthroughs in all areas of science since 1845. Respected and influential, it is known for making cutting-edge information accessible to the educated reader. From the latest in alternative energy technology to groundbreaking medical advances, the magazine explores and explains innovative developments, including what they mean to you.  Scientific American magazine features a question and answer column, where experts break down current concerns, such as the seriousness of emerging diseases and logistics in times of crisis. With in-depth reports on controversial topics like climate change and the ramifications of fossil fuel use, the magazine never backs down from its logical, empirical approach.  Focusing on the future, Scientific American magazine provides tantalizing peeks at emerging and converging technologies, which could change our understanding of the world and our place in it. Have you ever wondered why the Large Hadron Collider was built and what scientists are seeking? Scientific American magazine breaks down such topics as the Higgs boson particle in a way you can understand. The publication also keeps you abreast of exciting discoveries in our solar system and beyond.  The magazine brings the complicated world of science to the forefront, positing new possibilities that are built upon discoveries happening each and every day. Its novel approach to educating the general populace is always positive, with an eye toward finding solutions instead of lamenting the problems.  A subscription to Scientific American magazine helps you move forward with confidence in a complex world where change is the only constant."

Each issue offers commentaries and reporting on politics, culture, and events, with a focus that's both national and international; humor and cartoons; fiction and poetry; and reviews of books, movies, theater, music, art, and fashion. Several times a year special issues focus on a theme--music, fashion, business. The writing is mostly first-rate, frequently coming from top literary and journalistic talents. The New Yorker's weekly issues can seem overwhelming--so much good stuff to read, piling up so fast!--but it's as easy to dip in for a small snack as it is to wade in for a substantial meal. --Nicholas H.

Amazon.com Review  Focusing on a central theme in each issue, such as 25 party ideas (number 25: nautical party) or 35 quick and tasty dishes, Food & Wine indulges a broad range of culinary connoisseurs and thirsty enophiles. Expect a number of well-rounded recipes and festive commentary on the theme at hand, but don't expect that Food & Wine will be weighed down by said theme--each issue also contains a home shopping guide (in case you need to know where to purchase a green bamboo tray), restaurant reviews, a Drinks/Wine section, and shorter articles that run from ""Win a Date with a Chef"" to ""The Joy of Slow Cooking."" --A.J.
